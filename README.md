# k-Means-Clustering-in-Spark

In this project, we analyze k-means clustering algorithms(K-means and K-means++) with multiple centroid initializations and distance measures using Apache Spark. We also compare the performance of both these algorithms and other hyper parameter metrics by using different types of centroid Intilizations and cost functions.
